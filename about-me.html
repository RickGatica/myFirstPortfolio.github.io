              Hello! my name is Rick Gatica Collarte and i make websites. Born
              and raised in Santiago De Chile. I've always been interested in
              technology and I enjoy doing my job too much (believe me, too
              much!).
            </p>
            <p>
              My life in internet started in 2007 when i was just 13 years old.
              I remember that what was fashionable was to have a facebook page,
              and my dedication at that time was to create fun quizzes such as
              which simpsons character you are or which pokemon you are
              according to your birth date.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started my web learning this year, but that does not mean that I
              am a complete novice, since I have been interacting with
              technology for 15 years, especially on the internet and I am quite
              aware of the evolutions that the web has had in the last decade, I
              am always aware of what is fashionable and new technologies, as
              this is the engine that drives my passion.
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
