            Hello! my name is Rick Gatica Collarte and i make websites. Born
            and raised in Santiago De Chile. I've always been interested in
            technology and I enjoy doing my job too much (believe me, too
            much!).
          </p>
          <p>
            My life in internet started in 2007 when i was just 13 years old.
            I remember that what was fashionable was to have a facebook page,
            and my dedication at that time was to create fun quizzes such as
            which simpsons character you are or which pokemon you are
            according to your birth date.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my web learning this year, but that does not mean that I
            am a complete novice, since I have been interacting with
            technology for 15 years, especially on the internet and I am quite
            aware of the evolutions that the web has had in the last decade, I
            am always aware of what is fashionable and new technologies, as
            this is the engine that drives my passion.
          </p> <br>
          <p>Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
